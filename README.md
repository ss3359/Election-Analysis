# Election-Analysis
In this project, we examine the voter turnout for each county in Colorado, the percentage of votes for each county, and the county with the highest turnout. 

# Overview of Election Audit
Python is a programming language which is highly useful and reliable for data analysts and data scientists. In this project, we help two election board employees, named Seth and Tom, to create tabulated results of the election across counties in the state of Colorado. We are tasked to report the total number of votes, the percentage of distrubution of votes by county, the largest county turnout, and the winner of the election based on popular vote. We have used Python throught this project to report our findings to the election board members, Seth and Tom.
