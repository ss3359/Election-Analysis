# Election-Analysis
In this project, we examine the voter turnout for each county in Colorado, the percentage of votes for each county, and the county with the highest turnout. 

# Overview of Election Audit
Python is a programming language which is highly useful and reliable for data analysts and data scientists. In this project, we help two election board employees, named Seth and Tom, to create tabulated results of the election across counties in the state of Colorado. We are tasked to report the total number of votes, the percentage of distrubution of votes by county, the largest county turnout, and the winner of the election based on popular vote. We have used Python throught this project to report our findings to the election board members, Seth and Tom. 

# Election Audit Results
In this project, we addressed the following outcomes of the election. The first outcome was the total votes cast in the congressional election. Here is the text file of the results presented in the project. Tom and Seth have provided the questions for us to answer throughout the duration of our election analysis. We have provided images of the text files to answer the questions about the 

1. How many votes were cast in this congressional election? 

      In this election, the total votes cast were 369,711 votes. This shown below and in the provided text file.

2. Provide the breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct. 

    In the election, we have broken down the votes by county. The percentage distribution is shown below and is in the text file provided.

    The breakdown of votes for each county shows that Arrapahoe had the lowest county turnout and Denver had the highest county turnout. 
    
3. Which county had the largest number of votes? 

    We have wrote and executed code on printing out the county with the highest voter turnout. As we expected, the python code printed out the highest county turnout as Denver. This is shown below.

4. Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate recieved. 
   In this project, we have wrote and executed code describing the percent breakdown for each candidate in the election. Here is the grade breakdown as shown below.

   We can see clearly the percent breakdown and is a readable file for any user. Acorrding to the code, relying on the excel spreadsheet containing the votes, Dianna DeGette is the winner of the turnout based on popular wote. 
   
5. Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes? 
   According to the python code, we calculated that Dianna DeGette is the winner. Here is the information below

   From our python script, we have printed out the winner, percent distribution and the number of votes on a separate file. Dianna had a 73.8 % turnout with a winning voting count of 272,892 votes. 

    
# Election-Audit Summary
Based on the data and the text file provided, we have found that Dianna DeGette winning the election. Based on our findings in this election, we have a buisness proposal to the election comission on how this script can be used for any elelction. One modification that needs to be considered for any election is calculuating the percentage of votes that were made in person, or voted with an abtintee ballot. The other factor to be cosidered is breaking down the number of votes by political party affiiliation. For future elections, we would like to find out the reasoning why people voted for each candidate. We would like to distribute the votes by age group, ethnicity, and gender. From this way, we can get a much clearer description why voters chose their desired candidate. 

In this particular election, this occured one year after the census was conducted. Therefore, the voting data may or may not be skewed. What would deepen our analysis further is to gather the data from the last election to this election. That way, we can clearly see a better representation of the distribution of voters before and after the census was conducted. 

Also, this election occured during the Coronavirus Pandemic. Therefore, traditional voting methods have been changed.
