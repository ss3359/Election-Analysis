# Election-Analysis
In this project, we examine the voter turnout for each county in Colorado, the percentage of votes for each county, and the county with the highest turnout. 

# Overview of Election Audit
Python is a programming language which is highly useful and reliable for data analysts and data scientists. In this project, we help two election board employees, named Seth and Tom, to create tabulated results of the election across counties in the state of Colorado. We are tasked to report the total number of votes, the percentage of distrubution of votes by county, the largest county turnout, and the winner of the election based on popular vote. We have used Python throught this project to report our findings to the election board members, Seth and Tom. 

# Election Audit Results
In this project, we addressed the following outcomes of the election. The first outcome was the total votes cast in the congressional election. Here is the text file of the results presented in the project. Tom and Seth have provided the questions for us to answer throughout the duration of our election analysis. We have provided images of the text files to answer the questions about the 

1. How many votes were cast in this congressional election? 
      In this election, the total votes cast were 369,711 votes. This shown below and in the provided text file.

    The breakdown of votes for each county shows that Arrapahoe had the lowest county turnout and Denver had the highest county turnout. We have wrote and executed code on printing out the county with the highest voter turnout. As we expected, the python code printed out the highest county turnout as Denver. This is shown below.
